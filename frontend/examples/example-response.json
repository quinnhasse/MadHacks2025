Dive into the benefits, challenges, and strategies to achieve transparency in AI.\n\nCandace Marshall\n\nVice President, Product Marketing, AI and Automation\n\nLast updated August 7, 2025\n\n## What is AI transparency?\n\nAI transparency means understanding how artificial intelligence systems make decisions, why they produce specific results, and what data they’re using. Simply put, AI transparency is like providing a window into the inner workings of AI, helping people understand and trust how these systems work.\n\nWe use artificial intelligence (AI) more than we think—some of us speak with Siri or Alexa every day. As we continue to learn more about the [impact of AI](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/impact-of-ai/), businesses must keep transparency in AI top of mind, especially when it comes to the customer experience (CX).\n\nTaking facts and figures from our [Zendesk Customer Experience Trends Report 2024](https://cxtrends.zendesk.com?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=2024_q1_cx_trends_zd_blogs_all), our beginner’s guide to transparent AI includes the significance of AI transparency and its requirements, regulations, benefits, challenges, best practices, and more.\n\n**More in this guide:**\n\n- [Why is AI transparency important?](https://www.zendesk.com/www.zendesk.com#Why%20is%20AI%20transparency%20important?)\n- [AI transparency requirements](https://www.zendesk.com/www.zendesk.com#AI%20transparency%20requirements)\n- [Levels of AI transparency](https://www.zendesk.com/www.zendesk.com#Levels%20of%20AI%20transparency)\n- [Regulations and standards of transparency in AI](https://www.zendesk.com/www.zendesk.com#Regulations%20and%20standards%20of%20transparency%20in%20AI)\n- [The benefits of AI transparency](https://www.zendesk.com/www.zendesk.com#The%20benefits%20of%20AI%20transparency)\n- [Challenges of transparency in AI (and ways to address them)](https://www.zendesk.com/www.zendesk.com#Challenges%20of%20transparency%20in%20AI%20(and%20ways%20to%20address%20them))\n- [AI transparency best practices](https://www.zendesk.com/www.zendesk.com#AI%20transparency%20best%20practices)\n- [Examples of companies practicing transparent AI](https://www.zendesk.com/www.zendesk.com#Examples%20of%20companies%20practicing%20transparent%20AI)\n- [Frequently asked questions](https://www.zendesk.com/www.zendesk.com#Frequently%20asked%20questions)\n- [What’s next for AI transparency?](https://www.zendesk.com/www.zendesk.com#What%E2%80%99s%20next%20for%20AI%20transparency?)\n\n## Why is AI transparency important?\n\nIn the most simplified terms, transparency in AI is important because it provides a clear explanation for why things happen with AI. It helps us understand the reasons behind AI’s decisions and actions so we can ensure they’re fair and reliable. According to our CX Trends Report, 65 percent of CX leaders see AI as a strategic necessity, making AI transparency a crucial element to consider.\n\n> Being transparent about the data that drives AI models and their decisions will be a defining element in building and maintaining trust with customers.Zendesk CX Trends Report 2024\n\nAI transparency involves understanding its ethical, legal, and societal implications and how transparency fosters trust with users and stakeholders. According to our CX Trends Report, 75 percent of businesses believe that a lack of transparency could lead to increased customer churn in the future. Because [AI as a service (AIaaS)](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/ai-as-a-service/) providers make AI technology more accessible to businesses, ensuring AI transparency is more important than ever.\n\nThe **ethical implications of AI** means making sure AI behaves fairly and responsibly. Biases in AI models can unintentionally discriminate against certain demographics. For example, using [AI in the workplace](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/ai-in-the-workplace/) can help with the hiring process, but it may inadvertently favor certain groups over others based on irrelevant factors like gender or race. Transparent AI helps reduce biases to sustain fair results in business use cases.\n\nThe **legal Implications of AI** involve ensuring that AI systems follow the rules and laws set by governments. For instance, if an AI-powered software collects personal information without proper consent, it can violate privacy laws. Creating laws that emphasize transparency in AI can ensure compliance with legal requirements.\n\nThe **societal implications of AI** entail understanding how AI affects the daily lives of individuals and society as a whole. For example, using AI in healthcare can help doctors make accurate diagnoses faster or suggest personalized treatments. However, it can raise questions about equitable access based on the technology’s affordability.\n\n## AI transparency requirements\n\nThere are three key requirements for transparent AI: explainability, interpretability, and accountability. Let’s look at what these requirements are and how they pertain to training data, algorithms, and decision-making in AI.\n\n### Explainability\n\n**Explainable AI (XAI) refers to the ability of an AI system to provide easy-to-understand explanations for its decisions and actions**. For example, if a customer asks a [chatbot](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/chatbots-for-business/) for product recommendations, an explainable AI system could provide details such as:\n\n- “We think you’d like this product based on your purchase history and preferences.”\n\n- “We’re recommending this product based on your positive reviews for similar items.”\n\n\nOffering clear explanations gives the customer an understanding of the AI’s decision-making process. This builds [customer trust](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-trust/) because consumers understand what’s behind the AI’s responses. This concept can also be referred to as responsible AI, trustworthy AI, or **glass box systems**.\n\nOn the flip side, there are **black box systems**. These AI models are complex and provide results without clearly explaining how they achieved them. This lack of transparency makes it difficult or impossible for users to understand the AI’s decision-making processes, leading to a lack of trust in the information provided.\n\n### Interpretability\n\n**Interpretability in AI focuses on human understanding of how an AI model operates and behaves.** While XAI focuses on providing clear explanations about the results, interpretability focuses on internal processes (like the relationships between inputs and outputs) to understand the system’s predictions or decisions.\n\nLet’s use the same scenario from above where a customer asks a chatbot for product suggestions. An interpretable AI system could explain that it uses a decision tree model to decide on a recommendation.\n\n### Accountability\n\n**Accountability in AI means ensuring AI systems are held responsible for their actions and decisions**. With [machine learning (ML)](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/machine-learning-used-customer-service/), AI should learn from its mistakes and improve over time, while businesses should take suitable corrective actions to prevent similar errors in the future.\n\nSay an [AI chatbot](https://www.zendesk.com/service/messaging/chatbot/) mistakenly recommends an item that’s out of stock. The customer attempts to purchase the product because they believe it’s available, but they are later informed that the item is temporarily out of stock, leading to frustration. The company apologizes and implements human oversight to review and validate critical product-related information before bots can communicate it to customers.\n\nThis example of accountability in [AI for customer service](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/ai-customer-service/) shows how the company took responsibility for the error, outlined steps to correct it, and implemented preventative measures. Businesses should also perform regular audits of AI systems to identify and eliminate biases, ensure fair and nondiscriminatory outcomes, and foster transparency in AI.\n\n## Levels of AI transparency\n\nThere are three levels of AI transparency, starting from within the AI system, then moving to the user, and finishing with a global impact. The levels are as follows:\n\n- Algorithmic transparency\n\n- Interaction transparency\n\n- Social transparency\n\n\n**Algorithmic transparency** focuses on explaining the logic, processes, and algorithms used by AI systems. It provides insights into the types of AI algorithms, like [machine learning models](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/machine-learning-and-deep-learning/), decision trees (flowchart-like models), neural networks (computational models), and more. It also details how systems process data, how they reach decisions, and any factors that influence those decisions. This level of transparency makes the internal workings of AI models more understandable to users and stakeholders.\n\n**Interaction transparency** deals with the communication and interactions between users and AI systems. It involves making exchanges more transparent and understandable. Businesses can achieve this by creating interfaces that communicate how the AI system operates and what users can expect from their interactions.\n\n**Social transparency** extends beyond the technical aspects and focuses on the broader impact of AI systems on society as a whole. This level of transparency addresses the ethical and societal implications of AI deployment, including potential biases, fairness, and privacy concerns.\n\n## Regulations and standards of transparency in AI\n\nBecause artificial intelligence is a newer technology, the regulations and standards of transparency in AI have been rapidly evolving to address ethical, legal, and societal concerns.

In this manner, it lessens bias and unethical use of results.\n2. **Transparency:** Transparent AI ensures responsibility, allowing developers and companies to be accountable for what their AI models are doing. This is significant if there are errors or otherwise unintended consequences that can pop up.\n3. **Gaining Trust:** In scenarios where users can actually visualize [how AI works](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-does-artificial-intelligence-work/), trust is more likely. Where decisions can have a life-changing outcome, such as finance or healthcare, transparency becomes fundamental.\n4. **Importance of Data Transparency:** To make AI systems fair and accountable, it is basic knowledge of where data is coming from and how it is being used. It identifies possible biases in data that can affect the outcomes.\n\n## AI Transparency Vs. AI Explainability\n\nAI Transparency VS AI Explainability\n\n## Uses of AI Transparency\n\nWith increasing integration of AI systems in everyday life, data and algorithms used to train them need to be transparent so users know how decisions are being made. Ensuring AI systems are designed and operated based on ethical principles will happen in this manner.\n\n- **Trust creation:** This transparency helps understand how data is collected and used or managed by an AI system. It would be an essential factor to build trust with the use of AI technologies, considering that people know what their [data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data/) does.\n- **Transparency and Reliability and Fairness:** With greater openness about algorithms and data underlying [AI models,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ai-model/) an organization can make sure its decisions are both fair and reliable. Transparency in algorithms and data also enables stakeholders to evaluate the fairness of outcomes driven by AI.\n- **Accountability:** By making it transparent, it will be easier to be accountable to the actions done by an organization's AI systems. Data sources and algorithmic processes can better be tracked and controlled while providing information about decision criteria.\n- **Compliance with Regulations:** Regulations like the EU AI Act and GDPR are requiring transparency about AI systems. Organizations have the need to comply with this regulation, which means informing users clearly about their use of data and algorithmic processes.\n\n## Challenges in AI Transparency\n\nBelow are the main challenges of AI Transparency:\n\n- **Algorithm's Complexity:** Vast majority of [AI models](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ai-model/), particularly deep learning, function as \"black boxes.\" Their inner workings cannot be easily understood, which creates complexity in algorithms that could otherwise make decisions transparently.\n- **Lack of Standardized Practices:** To date, there are no universally accepted standards or guidelines on AI transparency. This has resulted in inconsistencies across various organizations in terms of documenting and disclosing information about their AI systems, which ultimately impacts their trustworthiness .\n- **Data Privacy Issues:** Transparency may require providing information about the data involved in AI models, and that raises significant privacy concerns. Balancing transparency with the need to protect sensitive user information is a critical challenge.\n- **Evolving Models**: When AI systems are updated or retrained on new data, it is hard to maintain transparency. Algorithm and data changes may cause decision-making processes to shift, and it becomes difficult to inform stakeholders about how such updates change outcomes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAI transparency is essential for establishing trust, accountability, and ethically using artificial intelligence systems. It involves making the decision-making process. AI becomes more integrated in critical areas such as health and finance. however, the advantages it comes with include enhanced trust, effective performance monitoring, and a form of regulatory compliance.\n\nComment\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ai-transparency/)\n\n[What is AI Transparency?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ai-transparency/)\n\n[K](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kanishk7n57/)\n\n[kanishk7n57](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kanishk7n57/)\n\nFollow\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/ai-ml-ds/artificial-intelligence/)\n- [AI-ML-DS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/ai-ml-ds/)\n- [AI Blogs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/ai-blogs/)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is Responsible AI?\\\nHave you ever wondered how to ensure that the AI systems that are present in our lives are not harmful for us but rather work for the betterment of human lives?

It’s a challenge that businesses can address with more AI transparency, clarifying how [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/) makes decisions, why those decisions are made, and their impact on day-to-day operations. By prioritizing transparency, you build trust that AI tools will consistently make ethical, reasonable choices based on the available data.\n\nWith AI transparency, businesses benefit from auditable, repeatable processes, while customers are more likely to trust [digital labor](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/digital-labor/) output. Here's all you need to know about the what, why, and how of AI transparency.\n\nAI transparency means showing how your AI system operates — what data it uses, how it makes decisions, and why it delivers certain results — so people can understand and trust what it’s doing. As AI technologies have become increasingly central to business processes and decisions, the importance of AI transparency has grown.\n\nConsider, for instance, that one of the earliest uses of AI was suggesting similar content for readers, watchers, shoppers, and other digital consumers. It’s a straightforward process where AI analyzes the user’s historical activity to find an element of sameness to make a new recommendation.\n\nNow, consider a business that uses AI to help inform financial decisions. AI tools need access to multiple secure and public-facing databases and must combine and curate this data to discover key trends. This creates a \"black box\" effect: Users have questions — and can get accurate answers — but lack visibility into the inner workings of AI. Because they don't know what's happening behind the scenes, they're reluctant to trust the AI outputs.\n\nTransparency helps solve the trustworthy AI problem. In practice, there are three levels of AI transparency:\n\n- **Algorithmic:** [Machine learning (ML)](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-machine-learning/) algorithms underpin AI operations. This is the \"how\" of AI: How does AI use data to make decisions? Algorithmic transparency reduces the risk of unexpected or unintended decisions by ensuring AI shows its work and demonstrates how it arrived at \"X\" conclusion using \"Y\" data.\n- **Interaction:** Interactions help users understand the \"why\" of AI decision-making. Interaction transparency is the free exchange of knowledge between users and AI tools. When users ask, AI solutions should explain the rationale behind their decision-making and give data that supports these decisions.\n- **Social:** Social transparency addresses the \"what\" of AI. What impact do AI tools have on businesses, users, customers, and society at large? Social transparency is often tied to legislation and regulation. For example, multiple states now require AI transparency for hiring practices to help reduce the risk of bias.\n\n[See how](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/)\n\nAI transparency has multiple parts. It consists of various factors and insights that help provide a comprehensive view of intelligent operations. There's no single path to trustworthy AI; instead, it's composed of three broad requirements.\n\nThis refers to the ability to explain how an AI model arrived at a specific decision or outcome. These descriptions must be clear, concise, and easily understood, not just by those with a technical background.\n\nConsider two examples of the same conclusion described in different ways.\n\n- _Example 1: Using a combination of local and cloud-based sales datasets, the model ran a weighted statistical analysis and delivered three pricing recommendations based on current and future conditions._\n\nThis description is cumbersome and confusing. As a result, it does little to improve AI transparency.\n\n- _Example 2: The solution compared sales and customer demand data from Q1 to Q2. While demand increased by 10%, sales only rose by 5%. Based on this data, here are three sales suggestions._\n\nThis description is clearer. It specifies what data was used, what conclusions were drawn, and offers actionable suggestions.\n\nExplainable AI (XAI) is a part of explainability in AI. XAI is the area of research and development that looks at how AI systems can be built to provide humans with transparency into its decisions.\n\nInterpretability focuses on understanding the general operations and decision-making of AI systems. This includes the data used by AI to make decisions, the source of that data, and the type of decision-making applied by AI technologies to data sources.\n\nAccountability in AI ensures that both AI systems and those responsible for them can be held accountable for their actions and decisions. While there are a number of frameworks currently in development by different countries or organizations, there are no universally-accepted frameworks yet.\n\nIf these requirements sound similar to the three levels of AI transparency, that's by design. The three requirements are simply the practical application of these levels.\n\nAI transparency plays a key role in the evolving digital labor market. Digital labor is the use of technologies, such as [AI automation](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-automation/) and [AI agents](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/what-are-ai-agents/), that mimic human decision-making and cognitive abilities. Using what's known as [agentic AI,](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/what-is-agentic-ai/) these agents can perform tasks, learn from interactions, and map processes to achieve goals without step-by-step instructions.\n\nThe evolving capabilities of these agents raise questions about how they arrive at their answers and what data they use to reach them. AI transparency helps answer these questions and offers five key benefits for your business.\n\nTransparency leads to trust. Consider a company experimenting with new AI tools to analyze [sales](https://www.salesforce.com/sales/artificial-intelligence/) data. After some trial and error, AI returns demand predictions and pricing recommendations.\n\nThe more transparent the model is, the more likely users are to trust the results. If teams know exactly which data sources were used and what decision-making processes were followed, they can replicate both the process and the outcomes. Trust comes over time as results consistently meet expectations.\n\nTransparency promotes responsibility by ensuring that both systems and people are held accountable for results.\n\nAI tools aren't perfect. They make mistakes, sometimes due to poor data, other times because AI algorithms aren't up to the task, and in some instances due to unintentional bias. Trustworthy AI operations provide a way to identify the root cause of inaccurate results and ensure that the right parties are held accountable.\n\nBias remains a challenge for AI systems. When tools are trained on data that is inaccurate or incomplete, the results may seem accurate but can carry substantial bias. Transparency helps identify and correct these biases before they cause harm.\n\nFor example, an analysis of an AI-enabled recruiting tool might discover gender or socioeconomic hiring biases. With this information, businesses can update and retrain their models for better results.\n\nAchieving fair and reliable results is the goal of any AI technology, but it is especially critical in high-impact sectors such as finance, healthcare, recruitment, or law enforcement. If AI uses inaccurate financial data to model potential investment outcomes, businesses could lose millions. Transparency helps reduce the risk of poor decision-making.\n\nMany industries and organizations are creating rules for the use of AI. For example, the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act prohibits the use of social scoring systems and manipulative AI tools. Any systems classified as \"high risk\" under the act must establish a risk management system, conduct data governance, and create technical documentation.\n\nTransparency makes all these tasks easier. The more businesses know about how their AI tools work, the better prepared they are to navigate new compliance challenges.\n\n[Talk to an expert](https://www.salesforce.com/form/einstein-gpt/contact-us/?d=pb)[Watch the video](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/series/salesforce_on_salesforce/episode/episode-s1e33)\n\nAI transparency is about balance. If models aren't transparent enough, teams may struggle to trust their results. However, too much transparency can also pose challenges. Some of the most common include:\n\nData protection and user consent are essential for security due diligence, and transparency can put these at risk. For example, if businesses fail to anonymize data, AI models may accidentally reveal protected information during analysis. Failing to secure model training data and AI\n\nIntellectual property (IP) and AI give your business a competitive edge. IP sets your products and services apart from competitors, while AI tools can help you stay ahead of the curve.\n\nTo make the most of both, balance is critical. Providing AI with complete IP details risks public exposure and the emergence of copycat products.

AI transparency refers to the ability to understand, interpret, and scrutinize how AI models function, make predictions, and influence outcomes. Without transparency, businesses, policymakers, and consumers face challenges in trusting AI-driven decisions, especially in critical areas such as finance, healthcare, and eCommerce.\n\nAI transparency is about ensuring fairness, accountability, and ethical decision-making. Companies that prioritize transparency build stronger consumer trust, comply with regulatory standards, and mitigate biases that can inadvertently impact AI-driven decisions.\n\n## The Key Components of AI Transparency\n\nAchieving transparency in AI requires a multifaceted approach that involves openness at various levels of the AI lifecycle. The key components include:\n\n### 1\\. Explainability: Making AI Decisions Understandable\n\nFor AI to be transparent, users must be able to understand how and why a model makes certain predictions. Explainability ensures that AI-driven decisions can be broken down into logical, interpretable steps, allowing businesses and end-users to grasp the reasoning behind them.\n\nFor example, in eCommerce, if an AI algorithm recommends a product, explainability would reveal the factors behind the suggestion whether it was based on past purchases, browsing behavior, or demographic data. This level of transparency reassures customers and allows businesses to optimize their AI strategies accordingly.\n\n### 2\\. Data Transparency: Understanding the Inputs\n\nAI models rely on vast amounts of data to make accurate predictions. Data transparency means businesses must be open about the sources of their data, how it is collected, and how it is used in AI models. Given increasing regulations around consumer data privacy, such as [GDPR and CCPA](https://wandz.ai/privacy-and-anonymity-recent-trends-in-compliance-and-why-you-should-care/), ensuring ethical and compliant data usage is critical.\n\nOrganizations that prioritize first-party data collection that’s gathered directly from user interactions, can improve transparency while reducing reliance on third-party data sources. This approach enhances customer trust and supports cookieless personalization strategies that align with privacy laws.\n\n### 3\\. Bias Mitigation: Addressing Fairness and Ethical Concerns\n\nAI systems can unintentionally reinforce biases present in the training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Transparent AI models actively identify, measure, and mitigate biases, ensuring fairness in decision-making.\n\nFor instance, AI-driven hiring tools have been scrutinized for favoring certain demographics due to biased training data. A transparent approach requires businesses to continuously audit and refine AI models to prevent such biases from affecting decisions.\n\n## Why Businesses Need AI Transparency\n\n### Building Consumer Trust and Confidence\n\nConsumers today are more informed and concerned about how their data is used. Transparency in AI fosters trust by giving users clarity on how AI-driven decisions impact their experiences. When businesses clearly communicate how AI influences pricing, recommendations, and personalization, customers feel more in control, leading to stronger engagement and brand loyalty.\n\nFor example, an online retailer that openly explains why a customer is receiving a specific discount based on their past shopping behavior or loyalty status, creates a more trustworthy shopping environment.\n\n### Regulatory Compliance and Ethical Responsibility\n\nGovernments worldwide are tightening regulations around AI and data privacy. Companies that lack transparency risk non-compliance with laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and emerging AI-specific regulations. By proactively adopting transparent AI practices, businesses can avoid legal complications while demonstrating ethical responsibility in their AI deployments.\n\nFinancial institutions, for example, are required to ensure AI-driven credit and loan approvals are transparent and non-discriminatory. Failure to provide clear explanations for automated decisions can lead to regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage.\n\n### Enhancing AI Performance Through Human Oversight\n\nAI models are not infallible. They require continuous monitoring and human oversight to maintain accuracy and reliability. Transparent AI systems allow businesses to identify errors, refine models, and optimize performance over time.\n\nFor instance, AI-powered customer service chatbots should be designed with transparency so human agents can intervene when necessary. If a chatbot provides incorrect responses, clear documentation on how decisions were made enables quick troubleshooting and improvements.\n\n## How Businesses Can Implement AI Transparency\n\n### 1\\. Adopt Explainable AI (XAI) Models\n\nExplainable AI (XAI) techniques help businesses create [AI models](https://wandz.ai/adaptive-ai-what-is-it-and-why-everyone-is-talking-about-it/) that are easier to interpret. These methods include decision trees, feature importance analysis, and model visualization tools. By leveraging XAI, businesses can ensure their AI systems are not just accurate but also understandable to non-technical stakeholders.\n\n### 2\\. Prioritize Ethical AI Governance\n\nEstablishing AI governance frameworks helps organizations set ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment. This includes forming AI ethics committees, conducting regular audits, and implementing fairness checks to prevent biases from influencing decisions.\n\n### 3\\. Educate Customers and Employees\n\nTransparency is not just about making AI explainable, it’s also about ensuring users understand it. Businesses should invest in educational initiatives that help employees and customers navigate AI-powered platforms confidently. Providing clear documentation, FAQs, and user-friendly explanations enhances trust and adoption.\n\n### 4\\. Provide Opt-Out and Control Options\n\nGiving users control over AI-driven decisions fosters transparency and trust. For instance, allowing customers to adjust personalization settings, opt out of automated recommendations, or access explanations behind AI-generated content ensures they remain informed and empowered.\n\n## The Future of AI Transparency\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, transparency will be a defining factor in its widespread acceptance and ethical use. Businesses that embrace transparent AI models will not only meet regulatory standards but also gain a competitive edge by fostering trust and accountability.\n\nBy implementing explainable models, ensuring ethical AI governance, and prioritizing consumer education, organizations can create AI systems that are both powerful and responsible. In the long run, transparency in AI is a business imperative that drives sustainable growth and customer loyalty.\n\n[Get started](https://wandz.ai/contact-us/)\n\nPrev Post\n\n#### [How Adaptive CX Improves Key Metrics for eCommerce Brands](https://wandz.ai/how-adaptive-cx-improves-key-metrics-for-ecommerce-brands/)\n\nNext Post\n\n#### [Leveraging Non-Personal Data to Build Hyper-Personalized Customer Journeys](https://wandz.ai/leveraging-non-personal-data-to-build-hyper-personalized-customer-journeys/)\n\n### Adapt to your customers in real-time with Predictive AI\n\n[Get started](https://wandz.ai/contact-us/)\n\n[Linkedin-in](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wandzai/)[X-twitter](https://x.com/wandz_ai)[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wandzai1)[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@wandzai)\n\n© Wandz.ai 2025.

In this manner, it lessens bias and unethical use of results.\n2. **Transparency:** Transparent AI ensures responsibility, allowing developers and companies to be accountable for what their AI models are doing. This is significant if there are errors or otherwise unintended consequences that can pop up.\n3. **Gaining Trust:** In scenarios where users can actually visualize [how AI works](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-does-artificial-intelligence-work/), trust is more likely. Where decisions can have a life-changing outcome, such as finance or healthcare, transparency becomes fundamental.\n4. **Importance of Data Transparency:** To make AI systems fair and accountable, it is basic knowledge of where data is coming from and how it is being used. It identifies possible biases in data that can affect the outcomes.\n\n## AI Transparency Vs. AI Explainability\n\n![ai](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241226111454411450/ai.webp)AI Transparency VS AI Explainability\n\n## Uses of AI Transparency\n\nWith increasing integration of AI systems in everyday life, data and algorithms used to train them need to be transparent so users know how decisions are being made. Ensuring AI systems are designed and operated based on ethical principles will happen in this manner.\n\n- **Trust creation:** This transparency helps understand how data is collected and used or managed by an AI system. It would be an essential factor to build trust with the use of AI technologies, considering that people know what their [data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data/) does.\n- **Transparency and Reliability and Fairness:** With greater openness about algorithms and data underlying [AI models,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ai-model/) an organization can make sure its decisions are both fair and reliable. Transparency in algorithms and data also enables stakeholders to evaluate the fairness of outcomes driven by AI.\n- **Accountability:** By making it transparent, it will be easier to be accountable to the actions done by an organization's AI systems. Data sources and algorithmic processes can better be tracked and controlled while providing information about decision criteria.\n- **Compliance with Regulations:** Regulations like the EU AI Act and GDPR are requiring transparency about AI systems. Organizations have the need to comply with this regulation, which means informing users clearly about their use of data and algorithmic processes.\n\n## Challenges in AI Transparency\n\nBelow are the main challenges of AI Transparency:\n\n- **Algorithm's Complexity:** Vast majority of [AI models](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ai-model/), particularly deep learning, function as \"black boxes.\" Their inner workings cannot be easily understood, which creates complexity in algorithms that could otherwise make decisions transparently.\n- **Lack of Standardized Practices:** To date, there are no universally accepted standards or guidelines on AI transparency. This has resulted in inconsistencies across various organizations in terms of documenting and disclosing information about their AI systems, which ultimately impacts their trustworthiness .\n- **Data Privacy Issues:** Transparency may require providing information about the data involved in AI models, and that raises significant privacy concerns. Balancing transparency with the need to protect sensitive user information is a critical challenge.\n- **Evolving Models**: When AI systems are updated or retrained on new data, it is hard to maintain transparency. Algorithm and data changes may cause decision-making processes to shift, and it becomes difficult to inform stakeholders about how such updates change outcomes.\n\n![what-is-AI-Transparency](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241226101922026569/what-is-AI-Transparency.webp)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAI transparency is essential for establishing trust, accountability, and ethically using artificial intelligence systems.

Without transparency, it’s challenging to address potential biases and ensure ethical use.\n\n## Why is AI transparency important?\n\nWhen AI operations are clear and comprehensible, stakeholders can trust that the technology functions as intended and that any decisions it makes are based on logical principles. This trust is essential for the widespread adoption of AI software in sensitive areas like healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where decisions can have significant consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, a lack of transparency in AI software often results in weakened user confidence and concerns about system integrity. A prime example of this is the current controversy surrounding ChatGPT’s use of generative AI, which critics argue operates in a ‘black box’ manner, meaning its decision-making processes aren’t fully understandable to users and even developers. Stakeholders are now calling for greater insight into how ChatGPT is trained and the mechanisms governing their outputs to ensure its responsible use.\n\nEmploying transparent AI practices from the get-go can help your organization avoid situations like this, promoting user trust and personal accountability at all times.\n\nAI transparency also empowers users by providing them with the information necessary to make informed decisions about their interactions with AI systems. When users understand how an AI operates, they can better anticipate its actions and have greater control over how their personal data is used. This is particularly important in contexts where AI technologies seriously impact individuals' lives, such as in hiring decisions, loan approvals, or medical diagnoses.\n\n51% of business leaders believe that transparency in AI technology is vital for their organization, while 41% have suspended the deployment of software due to potential ethical issues.\n\n## Requirements for AI transparency\n\nVarious factors play into AI transparency as a whole; businesses should strive to ensure that their systems are easily explainable, highly interpretable, and that accountability checks are in place to promote trust in their technology.\n\n### Explainability\n\nExplainability is a cornerstone of AI transparency as it makes the inner workings of AI systems understandable to humans. When AI decisions are explainable, stakeholders can comprehend the rationale behind the outcomes, which can often boost adoption rates. For example, in the medical field, explainable AI can clarify why a certain diagnosis was made, promoting trust in its recommendation.\n\nFurthermore, a better comprehension of AI’s decisions provides users with insights into how these systems operate, enhancing their control and engagement. When users can understand why an AI made a particular choice, they’re better equipped to interact with the system, challenge decisions, and make informed choices about their use of the technology.\n\n### Interpretability\n\nInterpretability is key in identifying biases and errors within AI systems. Transparent AI models allow for a thorough examination of how inputs are processed and transformed into outputs. This capability is paramount in detecting any unfair biases that may have been inadvertently introduced during the training process or errors that may lead to inaccurate decisions.\n\nMoreover, regulatory bodies often require interpretable AI software to ensure that it complies with legal standards and ethical guidelines. Interpretability allows for the thorough auditing of AI models, making it possible to demonstrate adherence to pertinent regulations. This is of particular importance in industries like finance and healthcare, where the repercussions of non-compliance can be severe.\n\n### Accountability\n\nWhen AI systems are transparent, it’s easier to trace actions back to their origin, allowing for clear identification of who or what is responsible for outcomes. This traceability is vital for addressing any issues that may arise, as it ensures that there are clear points of contact that can explain decisions and make necessary adjustments. Without accountability, negative impacts of AI may go unaddressed, potentially leading to less-than-desirable results.\n\nAdditionally, when organizations know that they’ll be held accountable for their AI systems, there’s a stronger incentive to prioritize ethical considerations. This includes ensuring that AI models are developed with care, tested rigorously, and monitored continually after deployment.\n\n## Benefits of AI transparency\n\nAI transparency offers the potential to significantly benefit both end-users and organizations. By providing customers with enhanced visibility into how an AI system works and businesses with valuable insights into how to improve their performance, transparent practices can serve to upgrade the AI experience for all parties involved.\n\n### Builds trust\n\nWhen users understand how AI systems operate, they’re more likely to trust the outcomes generated by these systems. Transparency fosters confidence by breaking down AI processes and allowing users to assess the reliability of AI-driven decisions.\n\nEven more, transparent AI software enables users to scrutinize inputs and outputs to ensure that the decisions made align with their expectations and are free from errors. This ability to validate AI-powered results can enhance users' confidence in the trustworthiness of these technologies.\n\nStudies have shown that [90% of business executives](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/trust-in-business-survey.html) believe that customers trust their companies, while only 30% actually do. This suggests that organizations may need to go further than they think in providing transparency sufficient enough to satisfy consumers.\n\n### Promotes accountability\n\nThe enhanced visibility provided by transparency in AI technology allows stakeholders to hold organizations accountable for the outcomes generated by their systems. This ensures that businesses and their software act responsibly in regard to the individuals affected by their actions, which typically leads to greater trust and confidence.\n\nEmbedding robust auditing mechanisms within an AI’s machine learning models can also significantly bolster accountability. Audits involve systematically assessing the model’s behavior, particularly in terms of performance disparities across different demographic groups. Conducting regular inspections verifies that any unfair practices are addressed promptly, limiting the potential for systems to disproportionately affect certain groups in a negative manner. Even more, these practices serve to hold developers responsible for that data that machine learning models are trained with, encouraging them to carefully select and preprocess information on every occasion.\n\n### Addresses data biases\n\nBy understanding the origins of biases in training data, businesses can take proactive measures to address them, such as collecting more representative data or employing bias mitigation techniques. Transparency enables stakeholders to evaluate the fairness of AI systems' results as well, helping to identify any partiality that may manifest in AI-driven decisions.\n\nAdditionally, transparent AI empowers individuals to inspect the methodologies used in these systems, as well as the variables considered in decision-making processes. This visibility enables organizations to identify biases encoded in algorithmic processes, such as skewed feature representations or biased decision rules.\n\nResearch has shown that approximately [38.6% of ‘facts’](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2022/05/thats-just-common-sense-usc-researchers-find-bias-in-up-to-38-6-of-facts-used-by-ai/) presented by AI may be biased, indicating that there’s still a long way to go in eliminating partiality from these systems.\n\n### Improves performance\n\nTransparent AI systems allow technical experts to collaborate more effectively, sharing best practices and lessons learned to improve technology performance. By providing visibility into AI software’s architectures, this enhanced visibility facilitates cross-disciplinary collaboration, allowing experts from diverse fields to contribute their expertise to optimizing AI technology.\n\nFurthermore, a culture built around transparency encourages continuous improvement, ultimately driving advancements in performan","score":0.5,"metadata":{"provider":"exa","exa_id":"https://www.freshworks.com/ai-transparency/","published_date":"2024-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Freshworks","highlights":["Today, we’ll dive into what AI transparency is, why it’s so important, and how sound transparency practices can benefit businesses and consumers alike.

This visibility into AI systems ideally is built into every facet of AI development and deployment, fromunderstanding the [machine learning model](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/feature/How-to-build-a-machine-learning-model-in-7-steps) and the data it is trained on, to understanding how data is categorized and the frequency of errors and biases, to the communications among developers, users, stakeholders and regulators.\n\nThese multiple facets of AI transparency have come to the forefront as machine learning models have evolved and especially with the advent of generative AI ( [GenAI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/generative-AI)), a type of AI that can create new content, such as text, images and code. A big concern is that the more powerful or efficient models required for such sophisticated outputs are harder -- if not impossible -- to understand since the inner workings are buried in a so-called [black box](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/black-box-AI).\n\n\"Basically, humans find it hard to trust a black box -- and understandably so,\" said Donncha Carroll, partner and chief data scientist at business transformation advisory firm Lotis Blue Consulting. \"AI has a spotty record on delivering unbiased decisions or outputs.\"\n\n## Misconceptions about AI transparency\n\nAI transparency is sometimes construed narrowly as being achievable through source code disclosure, said Bharath Thota, partner in the digital and analytics practice at management consulting firm Kearney.\n\nThis article is part of\n\n### [What is enterprise AI? A complete guide for businesses](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/Ultimate-guide-to-artificial-intelligence-in-the-enterprise)\n\n- Which also includes:\n- [How can AI drive revenue? Here are 10 approaches](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/How-can-AI-drive-revenue)\n- [8 jobs that AI can't replace and why](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Jobs-that-AI-cant-replace-and-why)\n- [8 AI and machine learning trends to watch in 2025](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/9-top-AI-and-machine-learning-trends)\n\nBut he said this limited view is built on the [outdated belief that algorithms are objective](https://www.techtarget.com/sustainability/feature/Breaking-the-cycle-of-algorithmic-bias-in-AI-systems) and overlooks the complexities of AI systems, where transparency must encompass not just the visibility of the code, but the interpretability of model decisions, the rationale behind those decisions and the broader sociotechnical implications. Additionally, IT leaders must carefully evaluate the implications of stringent data privacy regulations, such as [GDPR](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/General-Data-Protection-Regulation-GDPR) and the [EU AI Act](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/news/366573519/EU-AI-Act-sets-global-standard-for-managing-AI), and ensure that AI systems are used ethically to maintain stakeholder trust.\n\nFor example, merely revealing the source code of a machine learning model does not necessarily explain how it arrives at certain decisions, especially if the model is complex, like a deep neural network.\n\n\"Transparency should, therefore, include clear documentation of the data used, the model's behavior in different contexts and the potential biases that could affect outcomes,\" Thota said.\n\n## Why is AI transparency important?\n\nLike any data-driven tool, [AI algorithms](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/Types-of-AI-algorithms-and-how-they-work) depend on the quality of data used to train the AI model. The algorithms are subject to bias in the data and, therefore, have some inherent risk associated with their use. Transparency is essential to securing trust from users, regulators and those affected by algorithmic decision-making.\n\n\"AI transparency is about clearly explaining the reasoning behind the output, making the decision-making process accessible and comprehensible,\" said Adnan Masood, chief AI architect at digital transformation consultancy UST and a Microsoft regional director. \"At the end of the day, it's about eliminating the black box mystery of AI and providing insight into the how and why of AI decision-making.\"\n\nThe need for AI trust, [auditability](https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/podcast/Trust-but-verify-Digging-into-audits-for-AI-algorithm-bias), compliance and explainability are some of the reasons transparency is becoming an important discipline in the field of AI.\n\n\"Without transparency, we risk creating AI systems that could inadvertently perpetuate harmful biases, make inscrutable decisions or even lead to undesirable outcomes in high-risk applications,\" Masood said.\n\n## GenAI complicates transparency\n\nThe rise of generative AI models has put a spotlight on AI transparency -- and growing pressure on companies that plan to use it in their business operations. Enterprises preparing for generative AI need to improve data governance around the unstructured data that these large language models ( [LLMs](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/large-language-model-LLM)) work with.\n\n\"Generative AI models are often much larger and more complex than traditional AI systems, making them inherently harder to interpret,\" said Nick Kramer, leader of applied solutions at global consulting firm SSA & Company.\n\nDecision-making processes are less transparent in generative AI models due to the intricate interactions within the massive [neural networks](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/neural-network) used to create them. These models can exhibit unexpected behaviors or capabilities not explicitly programmed, raising questions about how to ensure transparency for features that weren't anticipated by the developers. In some cases, generative AI can produce [convincing but false information](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/A-short-guide-to-managing-generative-AI-hallucinations), further complicating the notion of transparency. It's challenging to provide transparency into why a model might generate incorrect information.\n\nAI transparency can also be complicated by LLMs that have limited visibility into their training data, which, as noted, can introduce biases or affect algorithmic decision-making.\n\n\"Unlike traditional AI that relies on clearly defined data sets, generative models trained on vast amounts of internet data make it difficult to trace the origins of specific outputs,\" Kramer said. And, on the front end, the role of [prompts](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-prompt) in shaping outputs introduces a new layer of complexity in understanding how these systems arrive at their responses.\n\nOne confounding factor for enterprises has been that, as the commercial value of GenAI rises, many vendors have increased the secrecy around their architectures and training data, potentially in conflict with their stated transparency goals. Also, the conversational nature of many generative AI applications creates a more personal experience for the user, potentially leading to overreliance or a misunderstanding of the AI's capabilities, Kramer said.\n\n## Transparency vs. explainability vs. interpretability vs. data governance\n\nAI transparency is built across many supporting processes. The aim is to ensure that all stakeholders can clearly understand the workings of an AI system, including how it makes decisions and processes data.\n\n\"Having this clarity is what builds trust in AI, particularly in high-risk applications,\" Masood said. The following are some important aspects of transparent AI:\n\n- **Explainability** refers to the ability to describe how the model's algorithm reached its decisions in a way that is comprehensible to nonexperts.\n- **[Interpretability](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/How-to-ensure-interpretability-in-machine-learning-models)** focuses on the model's inner workings, with the goal of understanding how its specific inputs led to the model's outputs.\n- **Data governance** provides insight into the quality and suitability of data used for training and inference in algorithmic decision-making.\n\nWhile [explainability and interpretability](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/feature/Interpre","score":0.3999999999999999,"metadata":{"provider":"exa","exa_id":"https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/tip/AI-transparency-What-is-it-and-why-do-we-need-it","published_date":"2024-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","author":"George Lawton","highlights":["Throughout the guide, we include hyperlinks to TechTarget articles that provide more detail and insights on the topics discussed.

Image: REUTERS/Aly Song\n\n##### [Raj Sharma](https://www.weforum.org/stories/authors/raj-sharma/)\n\nGlobal Managing Partner, Growth and Innovation,EY\n\nThis article is part of: [World Economic Forum Annual Meeting](https://www.weforum.org/meetings/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2025/)\n\n- Transparency and responsible frameworks are essential for building trust in artificial intelligence (AI), ensuring fair, safe and inclusive use to maximize its benefits.\n- Engaging diverse stakeholders and skills throughout AI design, development, and deployment fosters collaboration, reduces bias and boosts organizational buy-in.\n- Transparent governance, proactive communication and algorithmic guardrails are critical to mitigating risks, promoting trust and unlocking AI’s potential to transform industries and lives.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is poised to significantly transform industries, businesses and individuals’ lives in numerous ways. It will improve health, safety and education. Additionally, AI can empower us to address global challenges such as inequality, poverty and climate change.\n\nYet, despite AI’s potential as a significant force for good, massive fears and distrust remain. Nearly half (49%) of US respondents to a [YouGov survey](https://today.yougov.com/technology/articles/49099-americans-2024-poll-ai-top-feeling-caution) admitted feeling concerned about the technology, while 22% said they were scared.\n\nFurthermore, some media commentators have pointed to a [growing backlash against AI,](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/27/harm-ai-artificial-intelligence-backlash-human-labour#:~:text=The%20backlash%2C%20though%2C%20points%20out,to%20the%20growing%20AI%20backlash.&text=This%20article%20was%20amended%20on,to%20this%20has%20been%20removed.) which could limit organizations’ ability to deploy time-saving and sometimes life-saving AI systems that transform our world for the better.\n\nSo, how can leaders address people’s concerns to lead AI transformation with confidence?\n\n##### Have you read?\n\n- ##### [Davos 2025: What to expect and who's coming?](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/12/davos-2025-whos-coming-and-what-to-expect/)\n\n\n## Adopting a transparent approach\n\nI strongly believe that instilling confidence in AI during this era of widespread uncertainty and mistrust requires honesty and transparency from every player involved in implementation – an approach that, sadly, has not always been applied.\n\nPutting people – clients, employees and other stakeholders – at the heart of organizational AI strategies is also essential.\n\nFrom my own experiences of working with clients, I’ve seen that a transparent approach to AI implementation requires leaders to:\n\n### 1\\. Develop a framework that supports the responsible use of AI\n\nFrameworks help ensure that AI is used responsibly – that is, fairly, safely and inclusively, with appropriate accountability, transparency and consideration of its environmental impact. When stakeholders believe an organization uses AI responsibly, they are more likely to trust its AI models.\n\nOrganizations can adopt external AI guidelines like the [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework) or develop internal frameworks. EY has created the [ethical and responsible AI principles](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/ai/principles-for-ethical-and-responsible-ai), a framework used internally and externally with clients.\n\n### 2\\. Proactively engage with stakeholders from the outset\n\nKeeping humans in the loop in AI systems development is essential for two reasons. First, rather than making a top-down decision, stakeholders at every level must be involved. Second, people provide the essential monitoring and oversight that underpin transparency—they deliver critical assurance that AI models are working as intended.\n\n“\n\nBeing transparent about AI means being honest about what a system is intended to do.\n\n”\n\nWhen planning an AI implementation, it is vital to ask stakeholders about their pain points and how AI tools could address them. Upfront communication about what the system is intended to achieve and how it can aid people in their work will support the development of a robust business case; it will also help allay fears that AI might take their jobs.\n\n### 3\\. Involve diverse skills in the design and build\n\nAI tools will only be viewed as positive for society and organizational efficiency if diverse skills are involved in their design and build. A diverse development team is critical to mitigating the risk of bias – one of the greatest risks associated with AI systems.\n\nAlso, a diverse team can help the organization’s AI tools meet the needs and expectations of a broad range of stakeholders by bringing different experiences and perspectives to the table.\n\n### 4\\. Get the ‘village’ to collaborate with implementation\n\nTechnically speaking, it takes a village to build a new AI system – made up of technological experts and project management talent. The same principle applies to deploying the system once it has been built.\n\nThe village spans the whole organization – from data scientists and business process owners to HR, change management, and legal staff – to roll out the system and upskill the workforce to use it responsibly. Collaboration helps increase transparency around the new system and encourages high levels of employee buy-in.\n\n### 5\\. Apply the principles of good governance\n\nThe board should help set the organization’s AI risk appetite and provide high-level scrutiny over its AI strategy. It should also ensure that AI is responsibly used and deployed and that all users of AI tools receive appropriate training.\n\nAnother good principle is an approval chain for each AI use case, which will allow for proper evaluation of the risks and opportunities and appropriate application of guardrails.\n\nLoading...\n\n### 6\\. Embed guardrails into AI models\n\nGuardrails are integral to using responsible AI models. They can be regarded as algorithmic safeguards – a set of predefined filters, rules and tools designed to ensure that AI systems operate ethically and legally.\n\nRobust testing of AI models before they are used can help highlight where risks and vulnerabilities lie so guardrails can be implemented. They can prevent hallucinations, for example, and minimize the risk of AI models producing toxic outputs.\n\n## **Why we must be transparent about AI**\n\nBeing transparent about AI means being honest about what a system is intended to do, where it fits with the organization’s overall strategy, which benefits and pitfalls it brings and how it is likely to impact people. It also means explaining why an AI model makes the decisions it does.\n\nUnfortunately, many AI implementations today are often clouded in mystery, with powerful solutions developed behind closed doors by a small number of stakeholders. As a result, people don’t trust the tools and resist using them, which has detrimental consequences for our society.\n\nBecause of this resistance, we risk being held back from using AI technologies to transform businesses, grow economies and improve lives.

As we integrate AI into our daily lives, it is essential to adhere to the [UC AI Principles](https://ai.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/documents/ai-council-uc-responsible-ai-principles.pdf), along with relevant laws and policies that govern data usage, treating AI applications with the same caution and compliance as any other data usage.\n\nAt the University of California, AI transparency refers to the openness and clarity about how AI systems are designed, implemented, and used. Transparency fosters trust, ensures accountability, and allows stakeholders to understand and assess the impact and ethical implications of AI-driven decisions and processes.\n\n### UC Responsible AI Principles\n\nThe UC Presidential Working Group on AI developed the [UC Responsible AI Principles](https://ai.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/documents/ai-council-uc-responsible-ai-principles.pdf) to establish appropriate oversight and guardrails so UC may harness the full potential of AI’s transformative technology while appropriately addressing concerns about the potential risks, particularly bias and discrimination. These principles draw upon a growing consensus around the concept of responsible AI and various frameworks implemented across public and private sectors.\n\nAligning use cases with the UC Responsible AI Principles helps ensure UC procures, develops, and implements AI-enabled tools that advance both our systems and processes as well as our values.\n\n### What are the principles?\n\n**Appropriateness:** The potential benefits and risks of AI and the needs and priorities of those affected should be carefully evaluated to determine whether AI should be applied or prohibited.\n\n**Transparency:** Individuals should be informed when AI-enabled tools are being used. The methods should be explainable, to the extent possible, and individuals should be able to understand AI-based outcomes, ways to challenge them, and meaningful remedies to address any harms caused.\n\n**Accuracy, Reliability, and Safety:** AI-enabled tools should be effective, accurate, and reliable for the intended use and verifiably safe and secure throughout their lifetime.\n\n**Fairness and Non-Discrimination:** AI-enabled tools should be assessed for bias and discrimination. Procedures should be put in place to proactively identify, mitigate, and remedy these harms.\n\n**Privacy and Security:** AI-enabled tools should be designed in ways that maximize privacy and security of persons and personal data.\n\n**Human Values:** AI-enabled tools should be developed and used in ways that support the ideals of human values, such as human agency and dignity, and respect for civil and human rights. Adherence to civil rights laws and human rights principles must be examined in consideration of AI adoption where rights could be violated.\n\n**Shared Benefit and Prosperity:** AI-enabled tools should be inclusive and promote equitable benefits (e.g., social, economic, environmental) for all.\n\n**Accountability:** The University of California should be held accountable for its development and use of AI systems in service provision in line with the above principles.\n\n## Applicable Laws and Policies\n\nUC is subject to many laws, and has numerous policies, that apply to AI even if they don't explicitly mention \"artificial intelligence.\" Existing laws and policies on privacy, IT security, anti-discrimination, conduct, and more are just as relevant to AI and the data driving it as they are to any other framework. Essentially, if an action wasn't permissible before AI, it isn't permissible with AI.\n\nReview a list of [UC's applicable laws and policies](https://ai.universityofcalifornia.edu/applicable-law-and-policy.html) and learn more about how these policies relate to AI.\n\nAdditionally, UC Legal has prepared a [Legal Expertise Chart](https://ai.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/ai-ogc-24-06-28-practice-areas-expertise-chart-for-website-1.pdf) that serves as a guide to navigate the complex legal landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) across diverse areas, including privacy, intellectual property, discrimination, due process, and contract law. By mapping potential university activities to pertinent legal frameworks, laws, regulations, and guidance from federal and state agencies, this dynamic resource provides timely links to regulatory updates, best practices, and case law. It is an essential tool to support informed AI use and thorough risk assessment within the rapidly evolving AI policy environment.\n\n#### UC AI Transparency Report\n\nTransparency in the use of AI allows the University to more effectively assess potential risks and opportunities, analyze experiences and outcomes, and shape future initiatives.

AI transparency helps open this black box to better understand AI outcomes and how models make decisions.\n\nA growing number of high-stakes industries (including finance, [healthcare](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence-medicine), [human resources](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-hr) (HR) and law enforcement) rely on [AI models](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-model) for decision-making. Improving people’s understanding about how these models are trained and how they determine outcomes builds trust in AI decisions and the organizations that use them.\n\nAI creators can achieve transparent and trustworthy AI through disclosure. They can document and share the underlying [AI algorithm’s](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning-algorithms) logic and reasoning, the data inputs used to train the model, the methods used for model evaluation and validation and more. This allows stakeholders to assess the model’s predictive [accuracy](https://www.ibm.com/topics/model-drift) against fairness, [drift](https://www.ibm.com/topics/model-drift) and [biases](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-bias).\n\nA high level of transparency is essential to [responsible AI.](https://www.ibm.com/topics/responsible-ai) Responsible AI is a set of principles that helps guide the design, development, deployment and use of AI. It considers the broader societal impact of AI systems and the measures that are required to align these technologies with stakeholder values, legal standards and [ethical considerations](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-ethics).\n\n### The latest AI News + Insights\n\nDiscover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.\n\n[Subscribe today](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=news-urx-52954)\n\n## Why is AI transparency important?\n\nAI applications such as [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) [chatbots](https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots), [virtual agents](https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-agent) and [recommendation engines](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/recommendation-engine) are now used by [tens of millions of people](https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-granite-transparency-fmti) around the world each day. Transparency into how these AI tools work is likely not a concern for this level of low-stakes decision-making: should the model prove inaccurate or biased, the users might just lose some time or disposable income.\n\nHowever, more sectors are adopting AI applications to inform high-stakes decision-making. For example, AI now helps businesses and users make [investment choices](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence-finance?), [medical diagnoses](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence-medicine?), [hiring decisions](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-hr), [criminal sentencing](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-for-fair-sentences) and more. In these cases, the potential consequences of biased or inaccurate AI outputs are far more dangerous. People can lose lifetime savings, career opportunities or years of their lives.\n\nFor stakeholders to trust that AI is making effective and fair decisions on their behalf, they need visibility into how the models operate, the logic of the algorithms and how the model is evaluated for accuracy and fairness. They also need to know more about the data used that is to train and [tune](https://www.ibm.com/topics/fine-tuning) the model, including data sources and how data is processed, weighted and [labeled](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-labeling).\n\nIn addition to building trust, AI transparency fosters knowledge-sharing and collaboration across the entire AI ecosystem, contributing to advancements in AI development. And by being transparent by default, organizations can focus more on using AI technologies to achieve business goals—and worry less about AI reliability.\n\nAI Academy\n\n### Uniting security and governance for the future of AI\n\nWhile grounding the conversation in today’s newest trend, agentic AI, this AI Academy episode explores the tug-of-war that risk and assurance leaders experience between governance and security. It’s critical to establish a balance and prioritize a working relationship for both to achieve better, more trustworthy data and AI your organization can scale.\n\n[Go to episode](https://www.ibm.com/think/videos/ai-academy/governance-security-future-ai)\n\n## AI transparency regulations and frameworks\n\nThe web of regulatory requirements surrounding the use of AI is constantly evolving. Transparent model processes are critical to compliance with these regulations and to addressing requests from model validators, auditors and regulators. The EU AI Act is considered the world's first comprehensive regulatory framework for AI.\n\n### The EU AI Act\n\nThe [Artificial Intelligence Act of the European Union](https://www.ibm.com/topics/eu-ai-act) (EU) takes a risk-based approach to regulation, applying different rules to AI according to the risk they pose. It prohibits some AI uses outright and implements strict governance, [risk management](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-risk-management) and transparency requirements for others. There are additional transparency obligations for specific types of AI. For example:\n\n- AI systems intended to directly interact with individuals should be designed to inform users that they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious to the individual from the context. A chatbot, for example, should be designed to notify users that it is a chatbot.\n- AI systems that generate text, images, or other certain other content must use machine-readable formats to mark outputs as AI generated or manipulated. This includes, for example, AI that generates deepfakes—images or videos that are altered to show that someone doing or saying something they didn’t do or say.\n\nThe implementation of the EU’s [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance/gdpr-eu) led other countries to adopt personal [data privacy](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-privacy) regulations. In the same way, experts predict the EU AI Act will spur the development of [AI governance](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-governance) and [ethics](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-ethics) standards worldwide.\n\n### Guiding frameworks for AI transparency\n\nMost countries and regions have yet to enact comprehensive legislation or regulations regarding the use of AI; however, there are several extensive frameworks available. While not always enforceable, they exist to guide future regulation and the responsible development and use of AI. Notable examples include:\n\n- **The White House Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence:** Released on 30 October 2023 (and rescinded on 20 January 2025), the order addressed transparency in several sections. In Section 8 it specifically addressed protecting consumers, patients, passengers and students. It encouraged independent regulatory agencies to consider using their authority to protect American consumers from AI risks, including “emphasizing or clarifying requirements and expectations related to the transparency of AI models and regulated entities’ ability to explain their use of AI models.”1\n- **The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights:** The Blueprint is a set of five principles and associated practices to help guide the design, use and deployment of AI systems. The fourth principle, “Notice and Explanation,” directly addresses transparency: “Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should provide generally accessible plain language documentation including clear descriptions of the overall system functioning and the role automation plays, notice that such systems are in use, the individual or organization responsible for the system, and explanations of outcomes that are clear, timely, and accessible.”2\n- **The Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework:** Launched in 2023 following development at the G7 Hiroshima Summit, the Hiroshima AI Process is a set of guiding principles for the worldwide development of advanced AI systems that promote safe, secure and trustworthy AI. The framework calls on organizations to abide by 11 principles, several of which encourage “publishing transparency reports” and “responsibly sharing information.”3\n\n## AI explainability vs. AI interpretability vs. AI transparency\n\nAI transparency is closely related to the concepts of AI explainability and AI interpretability. These concepts provide insights that help to address the long-standing “black box” problem—the practical and ethical issue that AI systems are so sophisticated that they are impossible for humans to interpret. However, they have distinct definitions and use cases:\n\n- **AI explainability: How did the model arrive at _that_ result?**\n- **AI interpretability: How does the model make decisions?**\n- **AI transparency: How was the model created, what data trained it and how does it make decisions?**\n\n### AI explainability: How did the model arrive at _that_ result?\n\nAI explainability, or [explainable AI (XAI)](https:/","score":0.09999999999999998,"metadata":{"provider":"exa","exa_id":"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-transparency","published_date":"2024-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Alexandra Jonker, Alice Gomstyn, Amanda McGrath","highlights":["AI transparency helps people access information to better understand how an [artificial intelligence](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence) (AI) system was created and how it makes decisions.
